headway-key
===========

A simple WordPress plugin to remove Headway Theme admin features for all users except for a "super" admin.

This plugin will remove all of the user Headway buttons for logged-in users.  
If you want to create a "super admin", then replace all of the instances (3) where you see my username "swinterroth" with your username. (Must have the role admin) 
The specified user will then still have access to the admin side headway buttons but not anyone else, including other "admins".
